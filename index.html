<title>Synapse - FSM/EFSM learner interface for Erlang</title>

<h1>Synapse</h1>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Synapse provides an interface to Finite State Machine (FSM) and Extended Finite State Machine (EFSM) learning tools.
Currently, the only supported learning backend is <a href="http://statechum.sourceforge.net/">StateChum</a>, but Synapse provides a simple Erlang interface
that allows:

<ul>
<li>A set of traces to be <i>learnt</i>, producing an Erlang record representing the inferred state machine.</li>
<li>Two state machine representations to be compared, producing an Erlang record representing the <i>diff</i> 
- i.e. the changes necessary to convert the first into the second.</li>
<li>A state machine representation to be <i>visualised</i>, which opens a GUI window showing the state machine.</li>
<li>A state machine and diff representation to be visualised, which opens a GUI window showing the first state 
machine and overlaying the changes in the diff.</li>
</ul>
